# ORCO

ORCO (Organized Computing) is a Python package for defining, executing and persisting
computations in a straightforward fashion.

If you often find yourself in a situation where you need to:
 - run many computations with various combinations of input parameters
 - easily distribute the computation among many cores and/or nodes
 - persist the results to disk in a structured way
 - define dependencies between computations and pipeline them together 
 - avoid recomputing already executed computations when you add new inputs
 - observe the status of the computations while they are running

then ORCO is the right tool for you.
