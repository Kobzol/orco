# ORCO

ORCO (Organized Computing) is a Python package for defining, executing and persisting
computations in a straightforward fashion.

ORCO combines an execution engine for running computations with a database
that stores their results and allows you to query them. It forces you to be very explicit in
specifying how is your computation defined and what are its dependencies. This makes the code a bit
verbose, but facilitates reproducibility of your experiments.

## Installation

### Requirements

ORCO needs Python 3.5+.

### Installation via pip

```
pip3 install orco
```
